# Why Functional Programming matters?

I've given this talk twice, first at my company ([Mobile Jazz](https://mobilejazz.com/)), then at the [Sevilla Developers](http://www.sevilladevelopers.com) conference. It's an entry-level functional programming talk, aiming to show that it's not that difficult, and why is cool. With simple tips on how use this in regular languages, like Java or Swift.

- This repo has a markdown document containing the slides (for the nice [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/) presentation software)
- I've also exported them in PDF format.
- You can use a Playground to play with map, reduce, filter. Requires Xcode / Swift / A Mac :-D
